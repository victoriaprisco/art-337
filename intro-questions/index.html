        <li>My name is Vicky Prisco and I am a senior computer science major with a HCI minor.</li>
        <li>My background is mostly software engineering and web dev. I am taking this class have always been interested in making websites that are easy to navigate and enjoyable to use.</li>
        <li>I do have experience with these - I have been learning web dev for quite some time and always trying to improve!</li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to effectively structure and design websites to make them easy to use!</li>
        <li>I think that designing for screen will be different than paper because screens are interactive and navigate-able (scrolling, clicking), so there is a lot of communication that needs to happen about how a user should navigate and interact with the website that is mostly done with very little information and words.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords">Effective design site</a> - I chose this website because (I use it a lot and) I think that the color choices and visual style is very distinct - they use different colors for different games and it really encapsulates each game on the site. It's very minimal which allows the complexity of each game to take control instead of the user interface. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.etsy.com">Effective Communication</a> - I chose this one because I think that there is a lot of information for them to present (individual item listings, store listings, categories, prices, etc.) that are all communicated very well and easily understood for the user. There isn't much digging around on the site to get the information you need or to find products that you want.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Website that works well</a> - I chose this one because it is very functional and has to operate correctly. The controls for selecting dates and locations and specifying your search work really well and are very intuitive for the user. There are a lot of controls and other things where the usage might not be known beforehand by the user but it is designed in a way that is very easy to figure out without long text explanations.</li>
